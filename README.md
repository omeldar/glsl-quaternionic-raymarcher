# GLSL  Quaternion Raymarcher

A real-time WebGL renderer for exploring 4D quaternionic Julia set fractals. This project leverages the power of GLSL fragment shaders to perform all calculations and rendering on the GPU, enabling interactive exploration of these infinitely complex and beautiful mathematical objects.

The core of the renderer is a raymarching algorithm that computes the 4-dimensional Julia set for a given quaternion constant (`c`). The 4D fractal is then projected into 3D space for visualization.

### Technical Details

The rendering process is based on raymarching a distance-estimated function (DE) for the quaternionic Julia set. A quaternion is a 4-dimensional number of the form $w + x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k}$. The fractal is generated by iterating the function $f(q) = q^2 + c$, where both $q$ and $c$ are quaternions. A point is considered part of the set if its magnitude does not diverge to infinity after a number of iterations.
